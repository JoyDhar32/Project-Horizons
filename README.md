# Project-Horizons

## Description
Project-Horizon is an immersive first-person adventure game set in a mysterious forest. The protagonist, who lives in a humble hut, finds himself lost and trapped on an Iceland shrouded in dense fog. Your mission is to navigate through the fog and find your way back home. Along the journey, you will encounter various obstacles such as stones, hills, and boxes that hinder your progress. Overcome these challenges and rediscover your lost sanctuary.
